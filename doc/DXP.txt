Specification of DXP Protocol.

DXP is a message-oriented encapsulation protocol. It multiplexes
various messages into a single byte stream for transfer over TCP/IP,
HTTP, or for storage in files.

DXP protocol stream is a sequence of messages. Each message has the
following format:

message_length :: COMPACT_INT          // message length in bytes
message_body   :: byte[message_length] // message body

Message length MUST NOT be negative. Connection SHOULD be dropped if
negative message length is encountered.

Zero message length is used as a one-byte heart-beat indicator
(message body is empty) and MUST be skipped.

When message length is positive, then message body has the following
format:

message_type   :: COMPACT_INT          // message type
... followed by the rest of the message up to message_length

The following two messages types are part of DXP amd MUST be always
supported. Others application-specific.

MESSAGE_HEARTBEAT         = 0
MESSAGE_DESCRIBE_PROTOCOL = 1

HEARTBEAT messages MUST be ignored.

DESCRIBE_PROTOCOL message defines other message type that are being
transferred in this stream. See "DESCRIBE_PROTOCOL.TXT"

<h1 tags="dxFeed API, tutorial">dxFeed API Tutorial. Part 1: Basics</h1>

<p>This tutorial covers the basics of dxFeed Java API: how to create a connection to a data source, 
how to create a subscription to market data events and how to receive them.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>dxFeed API works under Java SE 1.5 or later version. 
The latest version of Java SE is recommended for the best performance.
You need to download the latest release of dxFeed Java API from dxFeed site via
<a href="http://www.dxfeed.com/downloads/api/java/latest-release/">this link</a>. Download
"api-dxfeed-qds-xxx.zip" file (where xxx is the version number) and unpack it to any directory. 
Inside this zip file you'll find a file named "qds.jar" which contains both QDS core code and 
dxFeed API implementation that is used in this tutorial.

<p>Getting the latest version opens access to all the latest features of API, but there is no need to
update each time the new version comes out, unless you want to use some of the newer features. The binary QDS transfer protocol
(QTP) is stable and compatible across all QDS and dxFeed API releases. 

<h2>Sample code walkthrough</h2>

<p>The simplest sample code for dxFeed API is shown below in its completeness. Cut-and-paste this piece
of code into a file named "PrintQuoteEvents.java" and you get a program that connects to the specified data source
address and prints quotes for the specified market symbol on the console.

<pre class="brush: java">
import java.util.*;

import com.dxfeed.api.*;
import com.dxfeed.event.market.*;

public class PrintQuoteEvents {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		String address = args[0];
		String symbol = args[1];
		DXFeed feed = DXEndpoint.create().connect(address).getFeed();
		DXFeedSubscription&lt;Quote&gt; sub = feed.createSubscription(Quote.class);
		sub.addEventListener(new DXFeedEventListener&lt;Quote&gt;() {
			public void eventsReceived(List&lt;Quote&gt; events) {
				for (Quote quote : events)
					System.out.println(quote);
			}
		});
		sub.addSymbols(symbol);
		while (!Thread.interrupted())
			Thread.sleep(1000);
	}
}
</pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXEndpoint.html">DXEndpoint</a> object
is created on line 10. It is the object that manages network connections and the lifecycle of
the corresponding resources. 
It is instructed to connect to the address that was specified as the first program argument 
via 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXEndpoint.html#connect(java.lang.String)">connet</a> 
method and the reference to the 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeed.html">DXFeed</a> 
object is retrieved.
DXFeed is the object that represents the data feed in your application. 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeedSubscription.html">DXFeedSubscription</a> 
for 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/event/market/Quote.html">Quote</a> 
events is created on line 11.
A single DXFeed
instance can have multiple subscriptions attached to it. A typical modular application 
has a single instance of DXFeed and multiple subscriptions. Each module has its own
subscription for the market data that it needs. dxFeed API implements each 
subscription via a separate agent in QDS core collector as explained in
"<a href="http://www.dxfeed.com/blog/2011/12/5/introduction-into-qds-architecture.html">Introduction into QDS architecture</a>".
The core aggregates all subscription requests and a total subscription is sent to the upstream 
data provider when connection is established. Incoming data is multiplexed to all interested agents.
A typical GUI application creates a separate subscription for each individual graphical component that needs marked data.
A typical web-based application creates a separate subscription for each session and keeps a reference to the corresponding subscription
object in the session object. DXFeedSubscription is 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html">Serializable</a> 
to facilitate session replication in highly available web-server configurations. 

<p>A listener for incoming events is installed on lines 12-17. 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeedEventListener.html#eventsReceived(java.util.List)">eventReceived</a> 
method on line 13 is invoked in a separate background thread that is
provided from dxFeed API thread pool by default. 
You can customize thread pool with
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXEndpoint.html#executor(java.util.concurrent.Executor)">DXEndpoint.executor</a> 
method. It is Ok to have long-running or blocking operations in eventReceived method.
The next batch of events for a given subscription is not delivered until a previous batch was processed, 
but events for different subscriptions are delivered concurrently as long as there are free threads in the pool.

<p>Quote is an example of 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/event/LastingEvent.html">LastingEvent</a>. 
They are never queued inside QDS code and your code is guaranteed to always get the most recent quote.
Stale quotes are dropped as soon as newer quotes arrive, so your implementation of eventsReceived method never 
has to deal with multiple quotes for the same market symbol in the same batch of events. The other feature of lasting events,
is that you receive the snapshot of the most recent event as soon as you subscribe to it. That is why it is important 
to install subscription listener first (line 12) and then subscribe to a particular symbol (line 18) with
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeedSubscription.html#addSymbols(java.lang.Object...)">addSymbols</a> method.

<p>Lines 19-20 are there to simply keep this simple program running forever.
If you run this program with <code>demo.dxfeed.com:7300 SPY</code> arguments, you'll see a number of 
log lines indicating the intialization of QDS, connection process, and quotes
from the dxFeed free demo feed for SPDR S&P 500 ETF that are printed with a statement on line 15.

<h2>Asynchronous behavior and error handling</h2>

<p>There is no error-handling code in the above sample, because none is needed. All necessary error-handling is fully encapsulated 
in dxFeed API. QTP network connections use periodic heartbeat messages to detect connectivity problems. If connectivity 
problem is detected then an automated reconnection routine is initiated. As soon as new connection is established, all subscriptions
are automatically sent to the remote data provider node and the most recent market information (quote in our example) is received.
Data listeners are notified on new events only if data had actually changed while connection was lost.

<p>That's why the 
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXEndpoint.html#connect(java.lang.String)">DXEndpoint.connect</a> 
method, for example, does not declare any exceptions. It throws an unchecked runtime exception 
(an instance of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html">IllegalArgumentException</a>)
if the syntax of the specified address string is invalid, which likely indicates a configuration problem with the software. 
However, it does not declare any checked exceptions 
(like <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html">IOException</a>)
to indicate a failure to connect to the data source, because the invocation of this method
only initiates the connection. This method does not block. 
DNS lookup, connection and reconnection process proceeds in the background 
and automatically recovers from any errors it encounters.

<p>The subscription if handled in an asynchronous way, too, so an invocation of
<a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXFeedSubscription.html#addSymbols(java.lang.Object...)">DXFeedSubscription.addSymbols</a>
method on line 18 only initiates a process to subscribe to specified symbols. 
It does not block and does not throw exceptions. Event listeners get immediate notification when this event is already available 
locally because some other subscription has subscribed to it, but otherwise the event will come at some later time.
If you subscribe to non-existing or invalid symbol this notification never arrives. 

<h2>Symbology</h2>

<p>Applications that are using dxFeed API typically
perform some application-specific steps to retrieve a list of valid market symbol, like 
reading them from a configuration file or to their symbol or portfolio database.
dxFeed symbology is explained in 
"<a href="http://www.dxfeed.com/downloads/documentation/dxFeed_Symbol_Guide.pdf">dxFeed Symbol Guide</a>"
and is based on symbols that are assigned by a specific exchanges, with a goal to keep world-wide 
recognizable symbols of US stocks, ETFs and indices intact. 
So, subscribing on "IBM" symbol gets you market data for International Business Machines, 
"GOOG" for Google, "SPX" for S&P 500 index, etc.

<p>dxFeed provides comprehensive lists of all available symbols from all available exchanges in Instrument Profile Files (.ipf).
The corresponding file format is explained in detail in
"<a href="http://www.dxfeed.com/downloads/documentation/dxFeed_Instrument_Profile_Format.pdf">dxFeed Instrument Profile Format</a>"
document. There is a corresponding <a href="http://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/ipf/package-summary.html">Instrument Profile API</a> 
to compose and parse them.
